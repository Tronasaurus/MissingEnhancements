##  MissingEnhancements

An addon to call out your laziness by pointing out which of your gear pieces are missing enchants, tinkers, weaves, or other crucial item enhancements. For when you want to pretend to be sweaty — but need help remembering to enchant your cloak.

---

### Features:

-  Scans your character sheet for missing:
  - Standard enchants
  - Engineering Tinkers (belt + cloak)
  - Tailoring Cloak Weaves
  - Shield spikes and effects
  - Weapon enchants
-  Profession-aware: Only scans for profession-specific augments if you actually have them.
-  Labels appear **next to each gear slot** on your character sheet.
-  Fully automatic — just open your character panel!

---

### Known Issues:

- Only updates while the character sheet is visible.
- Very old or obscure enhancements might not be detected correctly.
- Tailoring might not be up to date as I don't have access to a tailor.

### Installation:

1. Download and unzip into your `_classic_era_/Interface/AddOns` folder.
2. Make sure the folder is named `MissingEnhancements`.
3. Launch the game or type `/reload` once in-game.
